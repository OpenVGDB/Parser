In each discipline you control your athlete simply with the stylus, but you won't succeed without proper timing, speed, and managing your stamina. Results achieved in individual disciplines are stored in a table and compared with the best world scores. The total score in the decathlon is calculated using a real-world formula, thus it is possible to accurately compare your score not only to the world record but also to the other athletes participating in the competition, including up to three friends with whom you take turns during the game. Enjoy a stylish design which naturally complements the great playability of original sports games. But this time you don't have to worry about breaking your joystick. During the track events you have to move the stylus with the correct frequency and not waste your stamina.

"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Action Adventure,Fantasy","In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the Muggle and wizarding worlds and Hogwarts is no longer the safe haven it once was. Harry suspects that dangers may even lie within the castle, but Dumbledore is more intent upon preparing him for the final battle that he knows is fast approaching. Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemort's defenses and, to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old friend and colleague, the well-connected and unsuspecting bon vivant Professor Horace Slughorn, whom he believes holds crucial information. Meanwhile, the students are under attack from a very different adversary as teenage hormones rage across the ramparts. Harry finds himself more and more drawn to Ginny, but so is Dean Thomas. And Lavender Brown has decided that Ron is the one for her, only she hadn't counted on Romilda Vane's chocolates! And then there's Hermione, simmering with jealously but determined not to show her feelings. As romance blossoms, one student remains aloof. He is determined to make his mark, albeit a dark one. Love is in the air, but tragedy lies ahead and Hogwarts may never be the same again. In the game, players will return to Hogwarts to help Harry survive a fraught sixth year. They will also have a chance to engage in exciting wizard duels, mix and brew magical ingredients in Potions class and take to the air to lead the Gryffindor Quidditch team to victory. Players may even get sidetracked by Ron's romantic entanglements as they journey towards a dramatic climax and discover the identity of the Half-Blood Prince.","n/a","6.4","48","EA Bright Light","Jun 30, 2009 ","http://www.gamefaqs.com/ds/945910-harry-potter-and-the-half-blood-prince"

Once you begin your path down the Kappa Trail, you'll encounter coins to collect, boulders to shatter and various mini-kappas that can help you in specific ways. Just be sure to avoid the Devil Hand. If you need a break, you can collect paintings or cassettes from the Chumfish Shack, count plates at a sushi restaurant or test your mettle in the treacherous Trial of Tiles. With its cute graphics and charming story, your time with the kappa will certainly be memorable. Who knows what you'll find as you make your way through A Kappa's Trail?","n/a","8.0","81","Brownie Brown","Jun 14, 2010 ","http://www.gamefaqs.com/ds/980826-a-kappas-trail"

After commandeering a handful of rockets to rescue her, they've wound up on a strange (and sometimes scary) adventure through outer space. Now players must rescue both their classmates AND their teacher - and just maybe the whole solar system while they're at it. Explore strange planets. Players see the sights of this strange, sci-fi fantasy setting as they uncover the secret behind their teacher's disappearance in this epic role-playing game. The stylus controls everything, from combat to conversations to outfitting allies. Simple controls make it easy to play but a challenge to master. Players can link up wirelessly with five friends and explore the amigo dungeon together - they'll find unending challenges and incredible rewards as they delve into the depths of this unique multiplayer experience. Madeleine, a respected and powerful teacher at Will O'Wisp magical academy, tells her students that she will undertake a dangerous mission in space and trains them for combat should the need arise. After not hearing from her for some time, the kids stumble upon a hangar of rocket ships. One by one, they board individual ships and crash land on distant planets alone. Players hop from planet to planet assembling the group of classmates. Once together, they learn of an evil sorcerer - a former student of the academy who now has ambitions to destroy reality - and set out to stop him. The game's combat plays like a traditional role-playing game. The difference comes from the command wheel and the stylus interface. Players tap on the attacks they want to use and then tap on an enemy to target. The game focuses on magic attacks: Each character has a &quot;sign&quot; linked to one of the planets that determines the type of magic he or she uses. As the planets move through the solar system, the effectiveness of magic spells shifts, requiring an ever-changing battle plan: Monsters and characters grow stronger as their planets shift into prominence and weaker as they move out of those positions. Players can check the planets' positions by tapping on the astrolog.","7.5","7.4","69","Brownie Brown","Oct 23, 2006 ","http://www.gamefaqs.com/ds/925593-magical-starsign"

"Rainbow Islands Revolution","Action,Platformer,2D","Rainbow Islands Revolution is an update of a Rainbow Islands, the sequel to Bubble Bobble, taking the form of a platform game where the player must ascend through vertical levels that are slowly sinking into the ocean. The objective of the source material is to reach the top of each level, taking out any enemies in the way by firing magical rainbows that can trap or eliminate foes as well as providing bridges for the player to walk on. Rainbows remain onscreen for a short amount of time but can be ?broken? by the player if they jump on them. Once broken, the rainbow will fall off the screen, taking out the first enemy it touches. The game also features a pleasing bonus item system where dispatched enemies leave behind items of food that have varying point values and power-ups that have a range of helpful effects. The major feature of this re-interpretation is shifting the entire game away from traditional controls by implementing a global touchscreen control system which radically alters the way in which the game plays. The game is also displayed across both screens of the DS. Rather than being fired by a button press, rainbows are now drawn directly onto the gameplay area using the stylus and movement is executed by dragging the player?s character around the levels. The objective is still to reach the top of the level, but the time limit has been extended to account for the player being unable to move and use rainbows simultaneously.

"Reader Rabbit Kindergarten","Miscellaneous,Edutainment","Reader Rabbit Kindergarten is an educational adventure game based on the characters from the popular and long-running series of learning games for young children, Reader Rabbit. Intended for children ages 3-6, the game is designed to teach basic skills to prepare kids for success in kindergarten and provide a foundation for further learning. The game's main character, Reader Rabbit, and his sidekick, Sam the Lion, are flying their airship over a new island when they are mysteriously captured by a giant bubble wrap. They then come to realize they have landed in Balloon Town, an island made of balloons where all sharp objects including their airship are locked away in a palace. In order to free their airship and continue on their journey, they must first gain access to the palace by helping the band wake-up the sleeping bull in front of the palace. To do this they must gather the 5 different instruments for the band that have been scattered around Balloon Town. In order to receive an instrument, players must help Reader Rabbit and Sam in a series of educational mini-games designed to teach kids basic skills such as memory, recognizing patters, simple math, phonics, rhyming, following directions and placing items in order. All mini-games have simplistic point-and-click controls using the Nintendo DS touch screen interface.
