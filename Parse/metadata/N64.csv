"1080: TenEighty Snowboarding","US","Sports,Alternative,Snowboarding","You're taking a Tahoe 155 snowboard down a steep, bumpy incline at night and you're about to top off an Indy Nosebone with a 360 Air, and you haven't even left your living room! You're playing 1080 (Ten Eighty) Snowboarding, a game so intense you'll be brushing the snow off your goggles. With five different boarders, eight different Lamar snowboards, more than 25 tricks, a Half-Pipe and six different courses, this is as close as you'll get to the real thing without hopping on the next ski lift.","7.8","7.1","70","Nintendo","Mar 31, 1998 ","http://www.gamefaqs.com/n64/196500-1080-teneighty-snowboarding"
