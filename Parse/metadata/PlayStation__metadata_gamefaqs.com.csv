With the advanced power of the Emotion Engine, the designers for NASCAR 2001 have been able to duplicate key driving points and strategies of some of the biggest names in the racing field. Gone are the days of one-dimensional AI, thanks to independent artificial intelligence routines geared towards each racer's personality--older drivers will wisely hold back until key moments, while the rookies and speed demons will be more prone to charging recklessly into turns. Thirty-five active drivers with their respective cars (complete with sponsors) are available to rip around 14 different tracks--including night races and (in a NASCAR game first) Daytona. Body deformation, particle effects (like smoke and fire), sparks, tire marks on the road, and wall marks ensure that it looks as good as it plays.","8.7","5.7","73","Black Box","Sep 19, 2000 ","http://www.gamefaqs.com/ps/258282-nascar-2001"

With its combination of award-winning gameplay and 2001 updates, NCAA GameBreaker is the best college football game available.The first college football game on the PlayStation 2 computer entertainment system, NCAA GameBreaker 2001 uses the power of this new system to put together the most menacing offensive line ever to take the college field.
