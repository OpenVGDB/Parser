The magicians used their magic to keep order, and peace reigned for a hundred years... Until an evil magician named Draygon, seeking to control and dominate his fellow men, began to use his powers for destruction and conquest. To combat Draygon's evil, the other magicians constructed four powerful swords of wind, fire, water and thunder. Used together, the swords would transform into the mightiest weapon ever created: the sword Crystalis. But Draygon seized the weapons and scattered them far and wide throughout the land. Only one hope remained: A young lad, himself a great magician, who had been imprisoned in a cave and frozen during the Great War. Though they knew it might destroy them, the wise magicians pooled all of their powers in an attempt to revive him.

In CRYSTALIS, you play the role of the young magician, making your way through Draygon's hostile land in an effort to locate the weapons you will need to defeat him.

"8 Eyes","US","Action,Platformer,2D","After hundreds of years of chaos, mankind has finally emerged from the ruins of nuclear war. This world of the distant future has once again flourished under the guidance of the Great King, who harnessed the power of the 8 Eyes to rebuild the planet. These strange jewels of power were formed at the eyes, or center, of the eight nuclear explosionswhich nearly destroyed the Earth. In the wrong hands, the 8 Eyes could cause untold destruction... And now, they have been seized by the Great King's eight Dukes, in a desperate bid to gain control of the world for themselves. They have banished the King to the nuclear wastelands, and already their squabbling threatens to plunge the world into war once again! The task of retrieving the 8 Eyes falls to you, Orin the Falconer, the bravest and mightiest of the King's Guardsmen. With your fighting falcon, Cutrus, you must penetrate each of the 8 Dukes' castles. There you will face the Dukes' soldiers, and battle strange nuclear mutants such as living skeletons, giant wasps, and mud men. You must defeat the monstrous Boss of each castle to retrieve the Jewel of Power he guards. Then, to complete your quest, return the 8 Eyes to the Altar of Peace to await the return of the Great King, so that he may finish the rebuilding of Earth. Your reward will be the eternal gratitude of all mankind!","6.2","6.0","n/a","Thinking Rabbit","January 1990 ","http://www.gamefaqs.com/nes/587061-8-eyes"
