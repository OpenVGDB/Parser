As players enter their humble town after finding their crown, they are assisted by their advisors, especially Howzer, in taking on missions in the immediate area of town. With the success of each, as well as activities like farming and natural resources development, they will gain wealth in the form of in-game currency called 'Bol.' Once an essential infrastructure has been established in town a suggestion box is set up through which in-game characters can make quest suggestions to supplement those of your advisors. During quests players in the role of young King Corobo can control multiple subjects of his kingdom who follow and serve based on your kingly status. These subjects have different professions which come in handy in specific as well as general quest scenarios and should be chosen wisely. Additional training facilities can be constructed to retrain existing subjects as well as those that are added to your kingdom as it prospers and eventually needs to expand into surrounding territories. The world of Little King's Story is expansive and set on many levels. Although each level contains multiple possible boss battles, progression through the game levels always requires the defeat of a substantial boss. Battles become more intense as you set out to conquer the lands that surround your kingdom, although these are never too overbearing due to the game's easy to alter difficulty settings. As these campaigns against neighboring kingdoms proceed you are kept aware of the health and happiness of your subjects at home and that of your troops via an information bar at the top left, as well as a ticker scrolling across the screen. Balance their needs with the needs of an expanding kingdom and you may indeed become the best king ever.","9.0","8.5","87","Cing","Jul 21, 2009 ","http://www.gamefaqs.com/wii/943385-little-kings-story"

Intended for children ages 3-6, the game is designed to teach basic skills to prepare kids for success in kindergarten and provide a foundation for further learning. The game's main character, Reader Rabbit, and his sidekick, Sam the Lion, are flying their airship over a new island when they are mysteriously captured by a giant bubble wrap. They then come to realize they have landed in Balloon Town, an island made of balloons where all sharp objects including their airship are locked away in a palace. In order to free their airship and continue on their journey, they must first gain access to the palace by helping the band wake-up the sleeping bull in front of the palace. To do this they must gather the 5 different instruments for the band that have been scattered around Balloon Town. In order to receive an instrument, players must help Reader Rabbit and Sam in a series of educational mini-games designed to teach kids basic skills such as memory, recognizing patters, simple math, phonics, rhyming, following directions and placing items in order. All mini-games have simplistic point-and-click controls using the Nintendo DS touch screen interface. Once players have retrieved all of the instruments and gained access to the palace, they must complete two more mini-games (a listening comprehension/sequencing game and a reading skills game) before gaining access to their airship so they can continue on to a new adventure. The game is presented in a colorful cartoon style with short videos, full voice acting, and sing-along songs designed to engage young children while still teaching basic skills. Players will be able to adjust the difficulty level of all mini-games independently which can add hours of replay value.","n/a","n/a","n/a","Graffiti Entertainment","May4, 2010 ","http://www.gamefaqs.com/wii/980066-reader-rabbit-kindergarten"

The action centers around Fallos, mysterious creatures that resemble humans and have an ability to balance on a playing field of 3-D cubes. First, create a pair of Fallos inside your Wii Remote&trade; controller by shaking it up and down. Next, determine suitable places for the Fallos to land, then fling them to the selected cube with a swinging motion. After that, the Fallos are on their own. If your placement is sound, the Fallos will remain stable and you'll clear the stage after tossing a required number onto the cubes. But if the weight or locations of Fallos causes the cubes to tilt and sway too much, the Fallos will lose their balance and fall off. Adding to the challenge, you'll find that some cubes have different properties, making tosses tricky and further threatening the stability of the Fallos. Guide Fallos through dozens of single-player stages or invite family and friends to join you in two-player cooperative mode.","n/a","6.7","79","fyto","Sep 21, 2009 ","http://www.gamefaqs.com/wii/960593-you-me-and-the-cubes"
