"Pro Evolution Soccer 2014","Sports,Traditional,Soccer,Sim","Pro Evolution Soccer 2014 centers everything on the ball including how it moves and how players use it. First touch and sublime control are what set certain players apart from others. The ability to not only read a pass, but to be one step ahead and to know what is needed to gain yards on an encroaching defender. Trueball Tech allows the player to trap or knock on a pass using the analogue stick with detailed bar-centric physics determining the weight shift of the player and the height and speed of the pass, as to how the player's body will automatically shape to receive it. The Pro Evolution Soccer series has long since treated the ball as an individual entity, allowing the player huge amounts of freedom to pass into space, run on to a knocked-on counter, or produces short triangular passes to make space. Trueball Tech adds even more freedom, with full 360-degree control within several yards around the player and the ability to shield the ball from opposing players, use deft controls to wrong-foot them, and intuitive methods to master close control.","n/a","10.0","n/a","Konami","TBA 2013 ","http://www.gamefaqs.com/3ds/724847-pro-evolution-soccer-2014"

Alicia, unknown to Alice and Rabi, helped them both escape from their imprisonment. Frustrated with the fact of Alicia’s inability to communicate with Alice, she wished to become human in order to speak, hoping to become friends with Alice. The Queen learned of Alicia’s secret desire and banished her from her kingdom. Dubois a powerful witch with a questionable reputation and a foe of the Queen discovered Alicia and helped her escape from her imprisonment. Dubois is already familiar with Alicia’s desire to become human, and offered her assistance to help her become human.

Or will she be forever lost and forgotten in the world of Wonderland.
